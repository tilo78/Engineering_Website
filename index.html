                Mr. Poole is in a meeting, so we have a sub. Back to School Night starts at 6:30PM. The CBHSAA at Oranco is on Saturday, so I'm going to try to fine-tune my form during gararchery this afternoon, and pinpoint my sight settings tomorrow. The CBHSAA is more of a practice tournament than others, but I still want to shoot well. Fortunately, the crazy heatwave this past week seems to be dying away. It drizzled a bit today, and the weather report predicts rain on Saturday. Also, contradicting my belief in her immortality, QUEEN ELIZABETH HAS PASSED!

                On Thursday, we tried to toss and catch sticks simultaneously. A couple of my classmates are annoying. In class, we learned about lab safety and what mechanical engineering is. Yesterday, another Thursday, we were challenged to try our best to create a CAD of a kitchen appliance. I won a Kit-Kat bar for my toaster-oven replica.

                Today, I was absent from class. So, I wrote this on the 22nd.
