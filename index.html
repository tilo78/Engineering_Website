                In groups, we designed and modified water bottle rockets with cardboard, construction paper, flexible wood sticks, and duct tape and hot glue to hold it all together. It looked pretty good a day before the launch, but then we ended up not being able to fix the leaks in the bottle, so the rocket had to be taken apart and put back together. It looked a little messier, and it didn't fly very well, but this week was fun.

                Our project this week was to dissect a computer, examine the parts, and put it back together. We parterned up and filled out a worksheet too. I've never seen the insides of a computer before, so it was pretty cool. Everything, even the little silver dots, have labels and codes in tiny print next to them!

                I finished my animal prosthetic CAD yesterday. I designed a tail for a western fence lizard, so that it can break of its tail more than once. I wanted to embed a Spotify song, but most social media websites are blocked on this chromebook. But, YouTube isn't, so here's an interesting video:

                We finished our Rube Goldberg projects this week, and tested them. I don't remember exactly, but only our project was able to pop the balloon within 1 try in the final run. Multiple balloons were over-inflated and popped ahead of time - I was surprised every time. I think we're finally moving onto a new unit this week.

                Our class split into groups to work on building Rube Goldberg-style chain reactions, out of cardboard and tape. Compared to other experiences, my group isn't terrible, but it's still a little frustrating. I hope we can complete construction in time. Also, for Challenge Day, randomly assigned groups of 3 folded paper, weighed the paper with classroom objects, and tried to have them float on water for 5 minutes. My group added 185 grams, far too many in retrospect, and our paper boat sunk in 2 minutes.

                Mr. Poole is in a meeting, so we have a sub. I've heard every curse word and literally every derogatory term in this class. I like the classwork, but I could definitely do without around half of my classmates. Back to School Night starts at 6:30PM. The CBHSAA at Oranco is on Saturday, so I'm going to try to fine-tune my form during gararchery this afternoon, and pinpoint my sight settings tomorrow. The CBHSAA is more of a practice tournament than others, but I still want to shoot well. Fortunately, the crazy heatwave this past week seems to be dying away. It drizzled a bit today, and the weather report predicts rain on Saturday. Also, contradicting my belief in her immortality, QUEEN ELIZABETH HAS PASSED!

                On Thursday, we tried to toss and catch sticks simultaneously. A couple of my classmates are annoying. In class, we learned about lab safety and what mechanical engineering is. Yesterday, another Thursday, we were challenged to try our best to create a CAD of a kitchen appliance. Each side of the room was assigned a judge, and we needed to quickly make our CADs within the time limit. The judges were walking around and looking at our screens. We ran short of time near the end of class, but I ended up winning a Kit-Kat bar for my toaster-oven replica. My goal picture is on the left and a screenshot of my final CAD is on the right:
